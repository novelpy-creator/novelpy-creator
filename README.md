# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a project named "PyGame Novel" (NovelPy for short), now I'm going to change the coding way to more difficult so it took a lot time now!

The project will took more disk space in my computer more than before...

# About "PyGame Novel" (NovelPy for short)

A kinectic novel project using pygame.

# About "PyGame Novel Documentation" (NovelPy Doc for short)

Documentation of my kinectic novel project using pygame.

It's only included one tutorial, so it's still in development (use sphinx-build to compile it yourself.)

#  About "PyGame Main Menu" (MenuPy for short) [Archived]

A template I made for easy to create menus, and also it's a part of NovelPy as well (last used in "devel" version)
