# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a project named "PyGame Novel" (NovelPy for short), it's still in development.

# About "PyGame Novel" (NovelPy for short)

A kinectic novel project using pygame.

# About "PyGame Novel Documentation" (NovelPy Doc for short)

Documentation of my kinectic novel project using pygame.

It's only included one tutorial, so it's still in development (use sphinx-build to compile it yourself.)

#  About "PyGame Main Menu" (MenuPy for short) [Archived]

A template I made for easy to create menus, and also it's a part of NovelPy as well (last used in "devel" version)
